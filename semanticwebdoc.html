        <h2>A Little About Me:</h2>
        <p>My journey into loving to read began quite quickly in my memory. After learning the letters of the alphabet and their phonetic sounds, I started piecing them together to sound out words. I eagerly read any signs I came across and soon picked up my first book. However, what truly got me obsessed was Shel Silverstein's <i>"The Giving Tree."</i> After devouring many more of his works, I graduated to chapter books by 2nd grade, and from there, my passion for reading only grew. I always had a "fun read" in addition to whatever required reading my class had in literature. My voracious reading habits were soon noticed, and I was placed into UC Berkeley's summer program for gifted children for six years, until I was old enough to rebel against elective summer school. Over the years, I have devoured everything from classics like "Wuthering Heights" to cult classics like <i>"Harry Potter"</i> and <i>"Twilight</i>," and more niche books like <i>"Kafka on the Shore."</i> My favorite of all genres are historical books, I don't discriminate from fiction to nonfiction.</p>

        <h4>An Excerpt From a Poem:</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
            I took the one less traveled by,<br>
            And that has made all the difference.</p>
            <p> Robert Frost, <cite>The Road Not Taken</cite></p>
