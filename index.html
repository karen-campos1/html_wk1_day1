    <h1>The Mid-Atlantic Accent in Old Hollywood</h1>
    <p>The Mid-Atlantic accent, also known as the Transatlantic accent, is a consciously learned way of speaking English that was popular in the early 20th century. It was primarily used by the American upper class and the entertainment industry. 
    It blends American and British English and was often used by actors in old Hollywood movies to appeal to both American and British audiences.</p>
